          <h2>What Is Indirect Representation?</h2>
          <p>
            Direct representation means to appoint a professional to represent
            an entity as jointly liable for the import formalities, including
            duties, taxes, and relevant agreed-upon activities. The importance
            of such representation is acquired to clear the goods from customs
            on account of the applicant. Indirect representationÂ on the other
            hand means that the rights and obligations have been delegated and
            transferred to the representative to take over all stipulated
            procedures. The Primary reason for pursuing indirect representation
            is when importers do not have a residence in the target market. EU
            customs territory could be challenging because of incalculable
            risks, fees, and duties.
