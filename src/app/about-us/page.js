        <h2>What Is Indirect Representation?</h2>
        <p>
          Direct representation means to appoint a professional to represent an
          entity as jointly liable for the import formalities, including duties,
          taxes, and relevant agreed-upon activities. The importance of such
          representation is acquired to clear the goods from customs on account
          of the applicant. Indirect representationÂ on the other hand means that
          the rights and obligations have been delegated and transferred to the
          representative to take over all stipulated procedures. The Primary
          reason for pursuing indirect representation is when importers do not
          have a residence in the target market. EU customs territory could be
          challenging because of incalculable risks, fees, and duties.
        </p>
